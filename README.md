# Cracking the Coding Interview (in Rust)

This repository is my attempt to improve my Rust programming skills by working through the 189 questions in the the 6th Edition of Gayle Laakman McDowell's book, "Cracking the Coding Interview".

Some great Rust tutorials posted by @brndnmtthws [here](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/cracking-the-coding-interview-rust).

Posting publicly on GitHub so others can provide advice and recommendations for improving my approach to these problems.

Progress so far:

## Chapter 1: Arrays and Strings
Question 01: [Is Unique](https://github.com/tjards/cracking_rust/blob/master/src/ch01_q01_is_unique.rs)

Question 02: [Check Permutation](https://github.com/tjards/cracking_rust/blob/master/src/ch01_q02_check_permutation.rs)

Question 03: [URLify](https://github.com/tjards/cracking_rust/blob/master/src/ch01_q03_URLify.rs)
